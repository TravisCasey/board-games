# Board Games and Decision Trees
This repo is a collection of playable board games along with agents designed to play the board games. Custom games can be defined using the provided template that has the minimum attributes and functions required for the agents to play the game. Currently, checkers and an abstract 'game' defined directly using a tree are implemented; the latter is used for testing purposes. The agents currently search the tree using iterative deepening and a depth-first search. Modifications on this to be implemented are further pruning and transposition improvements, a Monte Carlo agent, and a deep reinforcement learning agent trained through self-play. A proof of concept build concerned with only checkers can be found in my [checkers ai repo](https://github.com/TravisCasey/checkers-ai).

The goal of this endeavour is an exploration into the strengths and weaknesses of various decision tree agents, and how this may vary from type of game, number of players, time constraints, etc. It is also a useful abstraction of what defines an agent and a game in a general enough context that most games can be successfully implemented, but regular enough that all the agents can play the games without modification. 

A work in progress.
